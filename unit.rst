 Unit testing
==============

.. TODO: find a nice example to use to do the interactive talk

Why
===

**If it's not tested, it's broken**

.. code-block:: python

    def smart_function(arg):
        if failure_condition:
            report_error(arg1)
        else:
            normal_behaviour(arg)


Can you see the problem?

Dynamic Python
==============

- names are bound at run-time
- things can change
